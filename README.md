# Project 2
This repository is a project for the course Stat 159/259 at UC Berkeley.
In this project, we analyze State of the Union speeches using modern NLP tools.

## What we do in this project
Clean and process text data using spaCy.
Compare linguistic patterns across U.S. presidents and time periods.
Build and interpret LDA and BERTopic models.
Compare specific words and how much they are used through time in the speeches.
